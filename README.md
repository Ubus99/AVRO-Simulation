# Autonomous Vehicle Remote-Operation Simulator (AVRO)

*This Project was ceated as part of a Master's thesis at THI (Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt)*

**Autonomous vehicles** need a human fallback operator in case the **automated driving system** is unable to resolve a situation.
In the case of commercially operated ones, the Human operator is likely to be located in a remote support center, managing many vehicles at once.

While this is becoming more common, there has been little research into the design requirements for such interfaces.
This Application proposes one such interface used to test remote operation in the laboratory.

The interface is not feature complete, but anyone is welcome to contribute.
